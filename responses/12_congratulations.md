Now, we just have to wait for the deployment to occur, and for the package to be published to GitHub Packages. When it's completed, you should be able to see it in the [Packages]({{ repoUrl }}/packages) section of your repository. You can get the deployment URL in the [Actions]({{ repoUrl }}/actions) log, just like the staging URL.
